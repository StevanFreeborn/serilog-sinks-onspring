# Serilog.Sinks.Onspring

The Serilog Onspring sink project is a sink for the [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) logging framework that writes log events to [Onspring](https://onspring.com/). In the Serilog logging framework structured logs are written to sinks. This sink writes structured logs to Onspring allowing you to leverage the features of Onspring to make log data actionable.

**NOTE:** This is an unofficial Onspring integration making use of the public Onspring API. This project was not built in consultation with Onspring Technologies LLC or a member of their development team.

**NOTE:** Onspring is primarily a business process automation platform not a log management platform. This sink is intended to be used in scenarios where you want to leverage the features of Onspring to make log data actionable. If you are looking for a log management platform you may want to consider other options.
